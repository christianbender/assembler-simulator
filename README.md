# Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator
A simulator which provides a simplified assembler syntax (based on NASM) and is simulating a x86 like cpu. Press Help inside the simulator to see an overview about the supported instructions.  

**This repository is a fork off [Schweigi/assembler-simulator](https://github.com/Schweigi/assembler-simulator)**

### Changes that I have done  

- Documented the code. Put in some comments.  
- In the example code I put a mention: ```You can also write in lowercase symbols```  
- Changed the repository link (Fork me on GitHub) in the ```index.html``` to this repository.  
- Changed the ```README.md```  
- Added a ```CONTRIBUTION.md``` file.  
- Added a clear button for clearing the code-input-field.  
- I added new commands:  
  - SQ (sq) : squares the content of the given register.  
  ```asm
    mov a, 3
    sq a ; after that the register A contains 9
  ```
  - POW (pow) : computes the power x^n  
  ```asm
    ; for example
    mov a, 2
    pow a, 3 ; after that the register A contains 8
  ```
  - MOD (mod) : computes the modulo a % b (a MOD b)  
  ```asm
    ; for example
    mov a, 15
    mod a, 4 ; after that the register A contains 3
  ```
