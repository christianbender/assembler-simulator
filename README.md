# Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator
A simulator which provides a simplified assembler syntax (based on NASM) and is simulating a x86 like cpu. Press Help inside the simulator to see an overview about the supported instructions. **This repository is a fork off [Schweigi/assembler-simulator](https://github.com/Schweigi/assembler-simulator)**
