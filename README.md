# Simple 8-bit Assembler Simulator
A simulator which provides a simplified assembler syntax (based on NASM) and is simulating a x86 like cpu. Press Help inside the simulator to see an overview about the supported instructions. **This repository is a fork off [Schweigi/assembler-simulator](https://github.com/Schweigi/assembler-simulator)**


### Features
- 8-bit CPU
- 4 general purpose registers
- 256 bytes of memory
- Console output

### How to build
Make sure you have <a href="http://www.gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> installed to compile the `asmsimulator.js` script.
Run `grunt` to build the project.

### Background
A technical introduction is available on my blog: [www.mschweighauser.com](https://www.mschweighauser.com/make-your-own-assembler-simulator-in-javascript-part1/).
